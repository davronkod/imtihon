            <h2>Cybertruck is built with an exterior shell made for <br> ultimate durability and passenger protection.
                Starting <br> with a nearly impenetrable exoskeleton, every <br> component is designed for superior
                strength and <br>
                endurance, from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless- <br> steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass.

            <h2 class="text2">If there was something better, we’d use it. Help eliminate <br> dents, damage and
                long-term
                corrosion with a smooth <br> monochrome exoskeleton that puts the shell on the <br> outside of the car
                and
                provides you and your passengers <br> maximum protection.</h2>
            <h1 class="text3">VERSATILE UTILITY</h1>
            <h2 class="text4">With up to 3,500 pounds of payload capacity and adjustable air suspension, Cybertruck is
                the most <br> powerful tool we have ever built, engineered with 100 cubic feet of exterior, lockable
                storage
                — including a <br> magic tonneau cover that is strong enough to stand on.</h2>

            <h1 class="text5">VAULT-LIKE STORAGE</h1>
            <h2 class="text6">Space for your toolbox, tire and Cyberquad, with room to spare. Utilize 100 cubic feet of
                exterior, lockable <br> storage — including the under-bed, frunk and sail pillars.</h2>
            <div class="image6"></div>
            <h1 class="text7">PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY</h1>
            <h2 class="text8">Now entering a new class of strength, speed and versatility—only possible with an
                all-electric design. The <br> powerful drivetrain and low center of gravity provides extraordinary traction
                control and torque—enabling <br> acceleration from 0-60 mph in as little as 2.9 seconds and up to 500 miles
                of range.</h2>
